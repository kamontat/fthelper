[update]
# Update a PR whenever out of date with the base branch. The PR will be updated

# blacklist labels).

# Kodiak will only update PRs with the `merge.automerge_label` label or if
# `update.require_automerge_label = false`.

# When enabled, _Kodiak will not be able to efficiently update PRs._ If you have
# multiple PRs against a target like `master`, any time a commit is added to
# `master` _all_ of those PRs against `master` will update. For `N` PRs against
# a target you will see at least `N(N-1)/2` updates. If this configuration
# option was disabled you would only see at least `N-1` updates.

# When enabled, Kodiak will only update PRs that have an automerge label
